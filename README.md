# Introduction

This repository creates a custom Vitis Acceleration Platform for a VCK190 that integrates 4x Xylon LogiCAM-GMSL2-AR0231 cameras along with Xylon LogiFMC-GMSL2. It includes Vivado logic design as well as Petalinux-built software platform. The final output from building this design will be a Vitis platform which can be used with v++ to link hardware accelerators and generate final executable image.

***Version: Vivado 2022.2***
